# Intro

TODO: write a brief introduction based on the previous introduction of schnitzer 2011 below

# Rationale for loading complete listing of ICD codes

The reason for importing the complete listing of ICD codes is to assist in extracting the ICD codes used as inclusion/exclusion criteria in previous literature, specifically where ranges of codes were defined, such as "X85 - Y03, Y08 - Y09"; not all codes in the X85 - X99 range are valid codes, for example, and by importing the ocmplete listing, we can generate a range of valid codes. These will be used as predictors in the analysis in the CHASe project.

# Loading ICD codes

The UK uses unmodified WHO-published ICD codes (unlike the US where they use the - CM modification, or Australia, where they use -AM). ICD-9 was used until 1996, and ICD-10 since then. 

## UK codes

These were previously imported from the UK Biobank data, and the processed data is loaded:

```{r}
icd9_codes_UK <- read_csv("./processed_ICD_codes/master_icd9_code_list_UK(WHO).csv")
icd10_codes_UK <- read_csv("./processed_ICD_codes/master_icd10_code_list_UK(WHO).csv")
```

## USA (CM) codes

These are included in the *icd* package for R.

```{r}
library(icd)
```

## General Equivalence Mappings for the CM versions of ICD

The latest GEM files were downloaded from TODO: source

```{r}
gem_icd9cm <- 
  read_fwf("./raw/2018_I9gem.txt", 
           fwf_cols(
             source = c(1, 5), 
             target = c(7, 13), 
             approximate=c(15,15), 
             no_map=c(16,16), 
             combination=c(17,17), 
             scenario=c(18,18), 
             choice_list=c(19,19) 
             )
           )

gem_icd10cm <- 
  read_fwf("./raw/2018_I10gem.txt", 
           fwf_cols(
             source = c(1, 7), 
             target = c(9, 13), 
             approximate=c(15,15), 
             no_map=c(16,16),  
             combination=c(17,17), 
             scenario=c(18,18), 
             choice_list=c(19,19) 
             )
           )

## for our purposes the distinction between forward & backward maps isn't relevant, so we can combine the two to simplify finding matches
gem_combined <- 
  bind_rows(
    gem_icd9cm %>% rename(icd9cm=source, icd10cm=target) %>% mutate(direction = "f"),
    gem_icd10cm %>% rename(icd9cm=target, icd10cm=source) %>% mutate(direction = "b")
  )
```


## Parsing code ranges

Sources often supply code definitions as ranges, e.g. *Y08-Y09*. Because of the complicated rules of how codes are defined, ranges need to be parsed into sequences, that is, *Y08-Y09* needs to be turned into the sequence *Y08,Y09*. This is not trivial, so below is an algorithm for producing these. Note that this is omitted in the report, but is included in the .Rmd source file!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
## helper function to generate codes from a range given in a string
## e.g. given "Y08 - Y09", generate c("Y08", "Y09") 
## this assume 3-character codes and own't work 
generate_codes_from_range <- function(codeRangeString) {
  ## if no hyphen in string, return the string
  if (!str_detect(codeRangeString, "-|–")) return(codeRangeString)
  
  hasLetters <- str_detect(codeRangeString, pattern="[a-zA-Z]")
  hasDecimals <- str_detect(codeRangeString, pattern="\\.")
  
  codes <- toupper(trimws(unlist(str_split(codeRangeString, pattern= "-|–"))))  # extract codes, and sort them
  numbers <- parse_number(codes)  # extract the numbers and sort them
  
  numCharacters <- max(nchar(codes))
  
  if (hasLetters) {
    lettrs <- gsub(codes, pattern="^([a-zA-Z]{1}).*$", replacement = "\\1")
    lettersAreSame <- lettrs[1] == lettrs[2]
  }
  
  incrementStep <- 1
  if (hasDecimals) {
    numDecimalPlaces <-  max(nchar(str_split(codes, pattern = "\\.", simplify = TRUE)[,2]))
    incrementStep <- 1 / 10^numDecimalPlaces
  }
  
  ## in the simple case where no letters are included, just generate a sequence from the numbers given and pad
  if (!hasLetters) {
      ## now we generate the pre-padded sequence of numbers - depending on the format required, they'll be modified next
    sequenceNumbersPrePadding <- seq(from=numbers[1], to=numbers[2], by=incrementStep)
    if (hasDecimals) {  # if it has decimals we pad using formatC for decimals, "f"
      finishedSequence <- formatC(sequenceNumbersPrePadding, format = "f", digits=numDecimalPlaces, width=numCharacters, flag="0")
    } else {  # if nop decimals, we pad by adding a "0" until desired width is reached
      finishedSequence <- str_pad(sequenceNumbersPrePadding, width=numCharacters, pad="0")
    }
    return(finishedSequence)
  } else { ## else if it has letters, it's a little more complicated 
    ## if the letters are the same
    if (lettersAreSame) {
      sequencePrePadding <- seq(from=numbers[1], to=numbers[2], by=incrementStep)
      ## pad the sequence to the required width - 1 to account for the letter, but differently depending on whether there are decimals
      if (hasDecimals) {
        paddedSequence <- formatC(sequencePrePadding, format = "f", digits=numDecimalPlaces, width=numCharacters-1, flag="0")
      } else {
        paddedSequence <- str_pad(sequencePrePadding, width=numCharacters-1, pad="0")
      }
      finishedSequence <- paste0(lettrs[1], paddedSequence)
      return(finishedSequence)
    } else { ## if the letters are not the same it's more complex, because we need to generate the sequences between the letters also
      # TODO: complete this bit from below
      lettersIndices <- seq.int(from=which(LETTERS==lettrs[1]), to=which(LETTERS==lettrs[2]))
      lettersSequence <- LETTERS[lettersIndices]
      
      ## for the middle sequence between the letters provided, figure out which numbers are needed, they'll go between 0 and a maximum number, e.g.
      ## for E75 to F12, we need E75-99 and F00-12; for E72.1 to F12.3, we needE72.1-99.9 etc.
      maxNumber <- (10^(numCharacters - 1)) - 1
      if (hasDecimals) maxNumber <- (10^(numCharacters-2) - 1) / 10^numDecimalPlaces
      if (hasDecimals) {

          as.vector(unlist(sapply(lettersSequence[c(-1,-length(lettersSequence))], function(x) paste0(x,numbersSequenceMiddleWithpadding)))),
          paste0(tail(lettersSequence,n=1),numbersSequenceRightWithpadding)
        )
      return(finishedSequence)
    }
  }
  ## note that we've omitted checking whether the produced codes are actually in use
}
```

## Helper functions

Below are some helper functions to use in looking at the codes

```{r}
## remove dot
remove_dot <- function(x) gsub(x, pattern="\\.", replacement="")

## helper function to expand range codes eg "960-978" into numeric range...
## and collapse to string eg "960,961,962"
expand_range_to_csv_simple_case <- function(this_range) {
  this_range %>% 
   str_split(., pattern="–|-") %>%  # the Schnitzer tables use mid-length dash
   unlist %>% 
   trimws %>% 
   as.numeric %>% 
   {seq(from=min(.), to=max(.), by=1)} %>%
   paste(., collapse=",")
}

## helper functions for generating forward & backward mapped codes from the CM GEM lists
compile_mapping_cm <- function(code) {
  lapply(code, function(x) {
      x <- remove_dot(x)
      gem_combined %>% 
      filter(str_starts(icd9cm, pattern=x)) %>%
      mutate(prefix_code=x)
  }) %>% bind_rows
}

## shortcuts for finding codes with a prefix
find_prefix_in_master_list <- function(this_code, master_list) {
  master_list %>%
    filter(str_starts(code, remove_dot(this_code)))
}
find_prefix_in_icd9 <- function(this_code) {
  find_prefix_in_master_list(this_code, master_list = icd9_codes_UK)
}
find_prefix_in_icd10 <- function(this_code) {
  find_prefix_in_master_list(this_code, master_list = icd10_codes_UK)
}
## shortcuts for finding codes by keyword
find_keyword_in_master_list <- function(key_word, master_list) {
  master_list %>%
    filter(str_detect(meaning, regex(pattern = key_word, ignore_case = TRUE)))
}
find_keyword_in_icd9 <- function(key_word) {
  find_keyword_in_master_list(key_word, master_list = icd9_codes_UK)
}
find_keyword_in_icd10 <- function(key_word) {
  find_keyword_in_master_list(key_word, master_list = icd10_codes_UK)
}
## shortcuts for looking up child codes in ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM
find_children_in_icd_cm <- function(parent_code) {
  tibble(
    code = icd::children(as.character(parent_code))
  ) %>%
    mutate(
      description = sapply(code, icd::explain_code, USE.NAMES = FALSE)
    )
}
```

# ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM cross-mapping

Cross-mapping was done manually in consultation with the master lists of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, and the online version of the [https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en](WHO ICD-10). To interpret the original intent of ICD-9-CM codes specified by Schnitzer et al. 2011 and Schnitzer 2004, we also consulted the -CM lists of codes as provided by the *icd* package, specifically using the function *icd::explain_code()*, and the online listing of codes at the (following address)[http://icd9.chrisendres.com/index.php].

Finally, the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM (and reverse) General Equivalence Mapping was also consulted - the helper function *compile_mapping_cm()* was used for this.

The helper functions defined earlier were used to find codes in the master lists by prefix, *find_prefix_in_icd9()*, or by keyword *find_keyword_in_icd9()*.

Some mappings were simple: e.g. gonococcal infection in ICD-9, *098*, has an equivalent ICD-10 code, *A54*.

The mappings were more complicated with edge cases, especially where codes fell into Not otherwise specified (NOS) or Other categories, because some conditions that ICD-9 categorised as Other were categorised as a separate code in ICD-10. For example: E988 in ICD-9 (Injury by other/unspecified means undeteremined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted), subdivided into: `r icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_starts(code,"E988")) %>% select(meaning) %>% kable`. Some of the 4th digit categories in ICD-9 exist as separate 3-character codes in ICD-10: `r icd10_codes_UK %>% filter(code %in% paste0("Y",c(19,26,27,31:34))) %>% select(meaning) %>% kable`.

## Failed attempt at fully algorithmic mapping

The plan was initially to compile a full GEM mapping from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM, and then to attempt mapping from the -CM variant codes to ICD-9 and ICD-10. This turned out to be too arduous a task: the fully automated GEM mapping produces several false leads, and omits some meaningful mappings that are easily spotted by a human, but difficult to write rules for.

# Importing ICD inclusion/exclusion criteria from past literature

# Gonzalez-Izquierdo et al. 2010

Arturo Gonzalez-Izquierdo kindly provided the list of ICD codes compiled by his team for the 2010 paper, which is in the file **\\raw_ICD_codes\\CODES - concern groups 2011 v6.xlsx**, specifically in the sheet *Victimization related*.

## Processing Gonzalez-Izquierdo et al. 2010 codes

The spreadsheet is nicely formatted for reading, and we can remove several rows and columns to make importing the data easier.
Columns 2,3,4 correspond to code description, ICD-10 code, and ICD-9 code, respectively. The data is in rows 2 to 40, which in Excel corresponds to the cell range **B2:B40**.

```{r}
agi_2010_file <- "./raw/CODES - concern groups 2011 v6.xlsx"
agi_2010_raw <- read_excel(agi_2010_file, sheet = "Victimization related", trim_ws = TRUE, range = "B2:D40")

## this produces a "condensed" file, meaning that several codes are expressed as ranges rather than individual values, and some codes are listed with commas separating individual entries
agi_2010_long_condensed <-
  agi_2010_raw %>%
  rename(description_icd10=Description, icd10code =`ICD-10 Codes`, icd9code=`ICD-9 CODES`) %>%  # rename to standard names
  filter(!is.na(description_icd10)) %>%  # remove blank rows
  mutate(  # extract header to include as broad maltreatment type variable
    maltreatment_type_agi2010 = if_else(
      condition = is.na(icd10code),
      true = description_icd10,
      false = as.character(NA)
    )
  ) %>%
  fill(maltreatment_type_agi2010) %>%  # LOCF on maltreatment type
  filter(!is.na(icd10code) & !is.na(icd9code)) %>%  # remove header row
  mutate(agi_index = 1:nrow(.)) %>%
  gather(-description_icd10,-maltreatment_type_agi2010,-agi_index, key="icd_version", value="code_decimal") %>%
  mutate(
    icd_version = case_when(
      icd_version == "icd10code" ~ 10,
      icd_version == "icd9code" ~ 9,
      TRUE ~ as.numeric(NA)
    ),
    code_decimal = gsub(code_decimal, pattern="\\s", replacement="")  # remove spaces
  )
```

Some codes have been entered as ranges rather than a list of codes. The ranges need to be expanded.

There will be two steps to this:

1. Split up comma-separated values and put them in separate rows
2. Split up ranges by generating all values in the range

```{r}
agi_2010_long <-
  agi_2010_long_condensed %>%
  separate_rows(code_decimal, sep = ",") %>%  # separate comma-separated values
  mutate(code_decimal = sapply(code_decimal, function(x) {generate_codes_from_range(x) %>% paste(collapse=",")}, USE.NAMES = FALSE)) %>%  # convert range-defined codes to comma-separated values
  separate_rows(code_decimal, sep = ",") #%>%  # split comma-seprated values again
  # filter((icd_version==9 & code %in% icd9_codes_UK$code_decimal) | (icd_version==10 & code %in% icd10_codes_UK$code_decimal))  # remove non-UK codes

## now write the file
write.csv(agi_2010_long, file = "./processed_ICD_codes/AGI_et_al_2010_ICD_codes.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

# Schnitzer et al. 2004

This paper sets the precedent to the Schnitzer et al. 2011 paper; in this paper they defined a set of ICD-9-CM definite maltreatment codes, which they would later complement with suggestive codes in the 2011 paper.

The way I extracted the codes was by loading the [HTML version of the paper online](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074937970400203X), and copying **Table 1. ICD-9-CM maltreatment codes** to a spreadsheet, **\\raw\\Schnitzer\_et\_al\_2004\_Table1.csv**

The table has three headings which need to be removed; then the code needs to be separated from the code description - these are in the format **E123: Description**

```{r}
schnitzer_2004_file <- "./raw/Schnitzer_et_al_2004_Table1.csv"
schnitzer_2004_raw <- read.csv(schnitzer_2004_file, header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, strip.white = TRUE)

schnitzer_2004_icd9cm <-
  schnitzer_2004_raw %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  rename(code_decimal = V1) %>%
  mutate(
    maltreatment_type_schnitzer2004 =  # extract the header based on phrases they begin with
      if_else(
        condition = str_starts(code_decimal, pattern="Diagnosis codes|External cause of"),
        true = code_decimal,
        false = as.character(NA)
          )
  ) %>%
  fill(maltreatment_type_schnitzer2004) %>%  # LOCF on the header

# Schnitzer et al. 2011

[Schnitzer et al 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.06.008) provide a list of ICD codes suggestive of child maltreatment, but don't provide the codes in an easily parsed format.

The following is a document of how I extracted the tables and converted them to a usable format.

I tried scraping the web article with no success, so I used a Google Chrome add-on called [*table-to-spreadsheet*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/table-to-spreadsheet/haidhlbpihfihbjcggmffnmhgiddjcoc) and saved all tables as .xlsx from the paper to folder *schnitzer2011\\raw*.

Note that MS Excel displays a warning about the data being corrupted when you try to open them, but displays the tables just fine - I assume this is the chrome plugin's fault, maybe not following the .xlsx format correctly.

The following tables were taken from the web article:

```{r}
dirTables <- "./schnitzer2011/"
dir(dirTables)
```

## Understanding the criteria

Each table is accompanied by additional notes denoted with superscript letters (^a^, ^b^, etc.) which need to be dealt with appropriately and removed from the table contents.

Depending on how we define what codes should count as suggestive of child maltreatment, we would use different tables. Schnitzer et al. 2011 compiled a larger list of suggestive codes through expert consultation and literature review which they then further refined by manually reviewing random samples of 50 cases for each ICD code deemed suggestive, and only retaining those where 66% or more of cases where thought to possibly or probably indicate child maltreatment.

Therefore there are two lists:

 * The prior list of suggestive ICD codes (table A1 in Schnitzer et al 2011) - this list is broader, i.e. a more liberal criterion
 * The empirically tested list of suggestive ICD codes (table 2 in Schnitzer et al 2011) - this list is narrower, i.e. a more conservative criterion

In addition, there is a further list of possible sexual maltreatment ICD codes that were not present in the dataset reviewed by Schnitzer et al 2011 and so could not be reviewed, yet may still be suggestive.

## Processing individual Schnitzer 2011 tables

For ease of use in later data analysis, the tables from the Schnitzer et al 2011 paper need to be converted into a format that can be used as a lookup table for use in analysing ICD 9 codes mapping them onto ICD 10 codes.

The tables will be converted to long format, with one row for each ICD code, and all other information in appropriate columns.

## Table 2 (narrower/conservative/empirical list of codes)

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_table2_file <- "./schnitzer2011/Table 2. ICD-9 codes suggestivea of maltreatment.xlsx"
schnitzer_2011_table2_raw <- read_excel(schnitzer_2011_table2_file, trim_ws = TRUE)
```

The data is currently in a non-standard format, having been grabbed from the table in the paper.

We can remove the last 4 columns because they report the percentage of cases confirmed as suggesting maltreatment on review. Additionally, we can remove the first row which contains no relevant information. We also rename the columns to a more easily programmed-with format, and remove the leading less-than sign from the age.

The type of maltreatment is currently a heading separating rows, but it should be added as a column instead. For this we use a last observation carried forward (LOCF), from *tidyr* library (*tidyr::fill*). Finally we remove the rows that were used for headers.

Next we deal with with the table notes denoted in the paper by superscript letters (^a^, ^b^).
From the paper:

> a
> The suggestive codes are those where more than 66% of records reviewed were classified as probable or possible maltreatment.
>
> b
> Designates a code with a sample size of less than 5.

Superscript ^a^ was only used in the description of the table, and superscript ^b^ has no bearing on the criteria. This means we can safely remove them from the final table.

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_raw <-
  schnitzer_2011_table2_raw %>%
  select(1:3) %>%  # keeping first 3 columns is same s dropping final 4 columns
  slice(-1) %>%  # remove 1st row
  rename(  # rename the columns to a standard format
    code_decimal = `ICD-9 code`, 
    description_icd9cm = `Code description`,
    age_less_than = `Age included (years)`
    ) %>%
  mutate(age_less_than = parse_number(age_less_than)) %>%
  mutate(
    maltreatment_type_schnitzer2011 =  # make a new column for type of maltreatment, using those rows that were used as headers
      ifelse(
        test = str_detect(code_decimal, "^ICD\\-9"),  # headers begin with string "ICD-9"
        yes = code_decimal,
        no = NA
      )
  ) %>%
  fill(maltreatment_type_schnitzer2011) %>%  # LOCF on maltreatment type
  filter(!str_detect(code_decimal, "^ICD\\-9")) %>%  # remove header rows
  mutate(
    description_icd9cm =  # use reg.ex. to find b in final position and remove it
      gsub(description_icd9cm, pattern = "a$|b$", replacement = "")
  ) %>%
  mutate(inclusion_index = 1:n())  # add an index for later use to each inclusion listed

index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_age <- 
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_raw %>%
  select(age_less_than, inclusion_index) %>%
  distinct
```

Next we deal with rows where multiple codes are denoted in same row, separated by commas. We'll leave the range-defined codes for poisoning intact for now.

Once we have each inclusion listed and paired with an index number, we'll put them in a separate table for later use in cross-mapping to ICD-10.

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_raw %>%
  separate_rows(code_decimal, sep=", ")
```

Now we separate the range-defined codes as well (poisoning codes *960-979*):

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm %>%
  mutate(
    code_decimal = 
      sapply(code_decimal, USE.NAMES = FALSE, 
             FUN= function(x) if (str_detect(x, pattern="–|-")) expand_range_to_csv_simple_case(x) else x)
    ) %>%
  separate_rows(code_decimal, sep=",") %>%
  mutate(code = remove_dot(code_decimal))  # add a code with the dot removed

index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_icd9cm <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm %>%
  select(inclusion_code = code, inclusion_code_decimal=code_decimal, inclusion_index)
```

Now Table 2 can be exported as an interim .csv for later use, with the caveat that the codes are still ICD-9-CM.

```{r}
# write.csv(schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm, file = "./processed_ICD_codes/Schnitzer_et_al_2011_empirical_inclusions_icd9cm.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

## Converting to ICD-9

ICD-9 and ICD-9-CM are supposed to agree in codes up to 4 characters long. Some codes in one version aren't defined in the other and vice versa. We'll check how many of the inclusion criteria in Schnitzer 2011 are missing in ICD-9, and if truncating the last digit yields an appropriate code:

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm %>%
  filter(!code %in% icd9_codes_UK$code) %>%
  mutate(truncated_code = str_sub(code, end = -2)) %>%
  left_join(icd9_codes_UK, by=c("truncated_code"="code")) %>%
  select(code_decimal.x, description_icd9cm, truncated_code, meaning)
```

Looking at the above, some truncated codes matched to ICD-9 codes all appear too unspecific as there's no guarantee that they would have been used for the same conditions.

The ICD-9 heading *852 Subarachnoid, subdural and extradural haemorrhage, following injury* seems to be a decent fit for ICD-9-CM *852.2 Traumatic subdural hemorrhage*. Although the latter code is a sub-code of *852* in ICD-9-CM, the 4th digit in the CM system specifies the location of the haemorrhage, whereas in ICD-9 the 4th digit specifies whether an an open intercranial wound was present - this distinction is made in ICD-9-CM at 5th digit level.

Note that there is already another *852* heading entry in the Schnitzer 2011 list, *852.2 Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage*; this will also be included by adding the less specific *852* code to the inclusions.

For the other ICD-9-CM codes without a match in ICD-9, we can attempt to search for keywords:

**362.81 Retinal hemorrhage**

```{r}
icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="retina") & str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="h.*morrhage|bleed"))
```

**V71.81 Observation for abuse/neglect**

```{r}
icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="observation") | str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="abus|neglect"))
```

**E869.4 Second-hand tobacco smoke**

```{r}
icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="expos") & str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="tobacco"))
icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="second") & str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="tobacco"))
icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="second") & str_detect(tolower(meaning), pattern="smoke"))
```

Second-hand smoke (ICD-9-M E869.4) was not included as a code in ICD-9, but it was in ICD-10 as code Z58.7 Exposure to tobacco smoke.

To conclude, there don't seem to be appropriate ICD-9 codes for the above ICD-9-CM codes.

The following table shows the ICD-9-CM and ICD-9 codes matched up so you can see that the mapping makes sense:

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm %>%
  left_join(icd9_codes_UK, by="code") %>%
  select(code=code_decimal.x, icd_9_cm=description_icd9cm, icd_9=meaning) %>%
  kable
```

All the above shown algorithmically matched codes appear to match in meaning.

Now we can construct a list of ICD-9-CM codes maped to ICD-9 codes.

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm_and_icd9 <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm %>%
  left_join(icd9_codes_UK %>% select(code, description_icd9=meaning), by=c("code")) %>%
  mutate(
    code_icd9 = case_when(
      str_starts(code, pattern="852") ~ "852",
      !is.na(description_icd9) ~ code,
      TRUE ~ as.character(NA)
      ),
    description_icd9 = ifelse(code_icd9=="852", icd9_codes_UK$meaning[icd9_codes_UK$code=="852"], description_icd9)
  )

schnitzer_2011_inclusions_icd9 <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm_and_icd9 %>%
  filter(!is.na(code_icd9)) %>%
  select(code = code_icd9, description_icd9, inclusion_index, maltreatment_type_schnitzer2011) %>%
  mutate(code_decimal = sapply(code, function(x) icd::short_to_decimal(x), USE.NAMES = FALSE)) %>%  # add decimal code also
  left_join(schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_icd9cm %>% select(inclusion_index,age_less_than) %>% distinct, by="inclusion_index")  # also merge the age included variable

index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_icd9 <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_icd9 %>% 
  select(inclusion_index, inclusion_code=code, inclusion_code_decimal=code_decimal)

```

```

## Exclusion criteria

Like with inclusion criteria, we will compile a table of exclusion criteria. These are extracted from *Tables A2* & *A3*, and are likewise in a one code per row format, except there are two columns of codes - one for the inclusion criterion and another for the exclusion criterion.

*Table A2* lists the samecriteria we've extracted from *Table 2* above, but with added exclusions. There is an additional note to exclude some codes where the 4th digit is .6 or.7, denoted by superscript *b*; superscript *a* refers to cases whgere N<5 cases were reported in the paper and can be safely removed. Additionally, there is an entry in Table A2 which lists an additional requirement for code **E869.4 Second-hand tobacco smoke** to include at least one from a list of codes. This will be included in a separate table of additional requirements.


*Table A3* lists all exclusion criteria for ICD-9-CM code **262: Other severe malnutrition**, so those will need to be added. 

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_table2a_file <- "./schnitzer2011/Table A2. Included ages, co-occurring exclusion codes and calculated weights for ICD-9-CM codes suggestive of maltreatment.xlsx"
schnitzer_2011_table2a_raw <- read_excel(schnitzer_2011_table2a_file, trim_ws = TRUE)

schnitzer_2011_table3a_file <- 
  "./schnitzer2011/Table A3. Exclusions for use with the nutritional deficiency and failure to thrive ICD-9-CM codes.xlsx"
schnitzer_2011_table3a_raw <- 
  read_excel(schnitzer_2011_table3a_file, trim_ws = TRUE) %>%
  rename(code=Code, condition=Condition) %>%
  mutate(
    malnutrition_index = 1: nrow(.)
  )
```

## Table A2

There is an additional note to exclude some codes where the 4th digit is .6 or.7, denoted by superscript *b*; superscript *a* refers to cases whgere N<5 cases were reported in the paper and can be safely removed. Additionally, there is an entry in Table A2 which lists an additional requirement for code **E869.4 Second-hand tobacco smoke** to include at least one from a list of codes. This will be included in a separate table of additional requirements.

Not all entries in Table A2 also have exclusion codes (or extra requirements), so we remove ones that don't to begin with. We also add the inclusion index generated earlier when we processed inclusion codes - this will allow us a to produce a more compact file.

We also remove superscript ^a^ from codes as it has no bearing on our project.

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_raw <- 
  schnitzer_2011_table2a_raw %>%
  select(exclusions=`Co-Occurring exclusion codes`, code_decimal=Code, condition=Condition, -Weight, -`Age included`) %>%  # rename exclusions and  remove the irrelevant Weight amd age columns
  filter(!is.na(exclusions)) %>%  # remove rows where no exclusion code was provided
  # mutate(exclusion_index = 1:nrow(.)) %>%  # add index variable
  left_join(schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_raw %>% select(code_decimal, inclusion_index), by="code_decimal") %>%  # add inclusion index
  mutate(
    condition = sub(condition, pattern="a$", replacement="")  # remove final a in Conditions that include it
  )
``` 

## Additional inclusion requirements

We'll start by compiling the table of extra inclusion requirements, which can be spotted in table A2 by the phrase *Include only* in the exclusions column:

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_extra_requirements_icd9cm <-
  schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_raw %>%
  filter(str_detect(exclusions, pattern="Include only")) %>%  # the phrase denoting additional code requirements
  mutate(exclusions = sub(exclusions, pattern="Include only with co-occurring code\\: ", replacement="")) %>%  # remove the preceding sentence
  separate_rows(exclusions, sep="; or |; ") %>%
  select(extra_required_range_icd9cm=exclusions,inclusion_index)

schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_extra_requirements_icd9_icd10_condensed <-
  schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_extra_requirements_icd9cm %>%
  mutate(
    extra_required_range_icd9 = case_when(
      extra_required_range_icd9cm == "480.0–487.8" ~ "480-487",
      extra_required_range_icd9cm == "490.0–491.9" ~ "490,491",
      extra_required_range_icd9cm == "466.0–466.19" ~ "466",
      extra_required_range_icd9cm == "493.0–493.9" ~ "493",
      TRUE ~ as.character(extra_required_range_icd9cm)
    ),

```

## Exclusions

Now that we've processed the extra requirements, we can remove that row from the remaining data, and the entry for malnutrition which specifies an entire separate table, which will be dealt with later.

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_raw_remaining <-
  schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_raw %>%
  filter(!str_detect(exclusions, pattern="Include only")) %>%  # the phrase denoting additional code requirements
  filter(!str_detect(exclusions, pattern="See Table")) #%>%  # the phrase denoting the separate malnutrition exclusions
  # mutate(entry_index = 1:n())  # add entry index for use in emrging later
```

We have `r nrow(schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_raw_remaining)` rows with a mixture of specified single codes, code ranges, and semi-colon separated codes and code ranges.

Included are code ranges with superscript *b* denoting exclusion codes:

>Unless 4th digit = .6 or.7.

The *b* always follows the second code in a range, i.e.: E815–E819^b^. Ultimately we will generate the full range of specified codes, and remove cases where 4th digit is .6 or .7 where noted.

Note also that all ranges where superscript *b* applies are listed as an interrupted range, separated by a comma: *E810–E813, E815–E819b*; superscript *b* applies to both of these ranges. This specifies external cause codes for transport accidents, excluding cases where the victim was a pedestrian or cyclist (4th digit .6 or .7). E814 is entirely for pedestrian victims and so was excluded in the range.

This means there are now these cases:
 * Single code entries
 * Semicolon-separated entries
    + Single codes
    + Code ranges
    + Interrupted code ranges, separated by comma

The elegant solution is to split comma-separated values first, then deal with range-defined codes by transforming the range into a long list of comma-separated codes, and then split comma-seprated values a second time.

Instead of compiling these line-by-line, we can group the exclusion codes, process them individually, and then re-merge them with the target codes. We'll split the codes with semicolons into separate rows, and it should be obvious afterwards that there's only a small number of groups of exclusion codes to deal with that repeat throughout the table.

## Cross-mapping exclusions to ICD-9 and ICD-10

Next we deal with the exclusions. We'll put semicolon separated values in separate rows to begin with, add an id, and then deal with them individually, mapping them to ICD-9 and ICD-10.

```{r}
schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_separated_semicolon_exclusions <-
  schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_raw_remaining %>%
  separate_rows(exclusions, sep="; ") %>%
  select(inclusion_index, exclusions)

index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd9cm_condensed <-
  schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_separated_semicolon_exclusions %>%
  select(exclusions) %>%
  distinct %>%
  arrange(nchar(exclusions)) %>%
  mutate(exclusion_index = 1:n())

index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_and_exclusions <-
  schnitzer_2011_exclusions_empirical_separated_semicolon_exclusions %>%
  left_join(index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd9cm_condensed, by="exclusions") %>%
  select(matches("index"))
```

As mentioned above, there are only a small(ish) number of separate exclusions listed: `r kable(index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd9cm_condensed)`

We also now have a lookup table linking the code entries for target codes in the exclusions table, and the exclusions: `r kable(index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_and_exclusions)`

Now that each of the unique groupings of exclusions have had an id assigned and we've also compiled a mapping of exclusion ids to inclusion ids, we can also convert the exclusion codes to ICD-9 and ICD-10.

```{r}
index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd9_10_condensed <-
  index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd9cm_condensed %>%
  mutate(
    icd_9 = case_when(

      exclusions == "756.51" ~ "756.50",  # osteogenesis imperfecta - different 5th digits
      exclusions == "733.10–733.19" ~ "733.1",  # pathological fracture - covers entire 4th digit range
      TRUE ~ exclusions
    ),
    icd_10 = case_when(
      exclusions == "767" ~ "P10-P15,P52.4,P52.6,P52.8,P52.9",  # birth trauma, plus several non-traumatic brain haemorrhages that were included in ICD-9-CM 767 birth trauma due to hypoxia/anoxia (but excluding intraventricular & subarachnoid haemorrhages)
      exclusions == "765" ~ "P05,P07",  # Disorders relating to short gestation and low birthweight

      exclusions == "E890–E897" ~ "X00-X09",  # ICD-9-CM ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY FIRE AND FLAMES (but without Other & NOS): ICD-10 Exposure to smoke, fire and flames
      exclusions == "E870–E876" ~ "Y60-Y69",  # ICD-9-CM MISADVENTURES TO PATIENTS DURING SURGICAL AND MEDICAL CARE
      exclusions == "733.10–733.19" ~ "M48.5,M80,M84.4,M90.7",  # ICD-9 pathological fracture: scattered across various ICD-10 codes
      exclusions == "E810–E813, E815–E819b" ~ "V20-V99",  # ICD-9 MOTOR VEHICLE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS (E810-E819) excluding cases where child was pedestrian or cyclist; ICD-10 transport accidents except ones where victim was pedestrian or pedal cyclist
      TRUE ~ as.character(NA)
    )
  ) %>%
  select(-exclusions)  # remove the original ICD-9-CM codes, no longer needed
```

## Separating exclusion codes to individual codes

Most exclusions are listed as ranges of codes, so we'll now separate them next.

The first step is to tag the line with superscript ^b^ so we can deal with it later, then the superscript ^b^ can be removed from the exclusion codes. Note that this only applies to the ICD-9 codes - ICD-10 codes specify pedestrian/cyclist at 3-character level and only appropriate codes have been included already.

Second, we'll separate comma separated codes.
Third, we'll expand codes expressed as ranges and convert them into comma-seaparated codes,
Fourth, we'll separate the newly generated comma-separated values again

```{r}
## helper function to deal with superscript b cases
## essentially, we are given a 4 character E-code, e.g. E815
## and we need to compile a range of 5th character codes, E815.1 - E815.9, but excluding .6 and .7
generate_5th_digit_codes_superscript_b <- function(code) {
  digits = c(1:9)[-c(6,7)]
  return(paste(code,digits,sep="."))
}

  index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd9_10_condensed %>%
  select(-icd_10) %>%  # remove icd-10 codes
  mutate(
    superscript_b = str_detect(icd_9, pattern="b$"),  # tag superscript b so we can deal with it later
    icd_9 = sub(icd_9, pattern="b$", replacement = "")  # remove final now that we have a tag
  ) %>%
  separate_rows(icd_9, sep = ", ") %>%  # separate comma-separated values

  mutate(  # convert superscript b codes to comma separated 5th digit codes
    icd_9 = 
      ifelse(
        superscript_b,
          sapply(
            icd_9,

            USE.NAMES = FALSE
          ),
        icd_9
      )
  ) %>%
  separate_rows(icd_9, sep = ",") %>%  # separate newly generated 5th digit codes
  select(-superscript_b) %>%  # the superscript b tag is no longer needed
  rename(exclusion_code_decimal = icd_9) %>%
  mutate(exclusion_code = remove_dot(exclusion_code_decimal))

index_table_schnitzer_2011_exclusions_icd10 <-

  rename(exclusion_code_decimal = icd_10) %>%
  mutate(exclusion_code = remove_dot(exclusion_code_decimal))
```

## Table A3

Table A3 is is again a case of parsing out codes that have been denoted as ranges of codes; we do this by separately dealing with single codes and codes that include a hyphen. There were no comma-separated codes listed, so we can go straight into converting to ICD-9 and ICD-10.

## Merging malnutrition-related exclusion codes to exclusions

We now add the malnutrition-related exclusion codes to the ICD-9 and ICD-10 exclusion codes already generated. In addition, we add a new index representing the malnutrition codes to the mapping of inclusion to exclusion code indexes.

```{r}
malnutrition_code <- "262"
malnutrition_index <- index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_icd9$inclusion_index[index_table_schnitzer_2011_inclusions_icd9$inclusion_code==malnutrition_code]

## Conclusion

We now have a cross-mapped to ICD-9 and ICD-10 list of Schnitzer 2011 inclusion codes, as well as exclusion codes (including for maltreatment) and a separate list of additional inclusion requirements for the 2nd hand smoke exposure code in ICD-10.

<!-- # Comparing inclusion tables between AGI et al. 2010 & Schnitzer et al. 2011 -->

<!-- ## Theoretical differences -->

<!-- Both groups' approach was to review existing litearture and consult stakeholders to define ICD codes for maltreatment. -->

<!-- The AGI et al. work defined a *hierarchy* of ICD codes on a spectrum ranging from definitive maltreatment (ICD-10 codes T74, Y06 and Y07) to decreasingly likely maltreatment. -->

<!-- > We used the alert features listed in the NICE guidance and expert opinion elicited during stakeholder meetings for the project to select codes that would be expected to trigger consideration or suspicion of child maltreatment. Causes of injury were classifi ed according to a hierarchy of codes reflecting a diminishing likelihood of maltreatment (table 1 and online table 1). None provide definitive evidence of maltreatment. We separately analysed codes for maltreatment syndromes(ICD-10 T74, Y06 and Y07) and grouped those related to maltreatment as assault, undetermined cause and adverse social circumstances (online table 1). -->

<!-- The Schnitzer work defined definite cases of maltreatment in the 2004 paper, and a separate list of non-definitive but suggestive codes of maltreatment with complex inclusion/exclusion criteria in the 2011 paper. -->

<!-- > A comprehensive list of ICD codes that represent illnesses and injuries suspicious for child maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect), was compiled following an extensive literature review and consultation with an advisory panel of child abuse and neglect experts convened for this project. This list of ICD codes also included specific inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., age limits, co-occurring ICD codes) for individual codes (The full list of codes is included in Appendix Table A1). These inclusion and exclusion criteria were often crucial for increasing the likelihood that the illness or injury with the code was related to maltreatment and not some other cause. For example, ICD codes assigned for an internal injury or fracture were excluded if there was an E code indicating that a motor vehicle crash was the mechanism of injury and the child was a motor vehicle passenger when injured. -->

<!-- ## Practical differences -->

<!-- Now that the codes from all three papers discussed above have been extracted, we can compare if the final lists of codes obtained from the papers differ. -->

<!-- ## How to determine if a code is included in a set? -->

<!-- Codes have been variously listed by authors either as chapter headings e.g. *T74 maltreatment syndrome*, or specific ranges or individual codes (i.e. *V15.49 History of abuse - other*). This means we need to have a robust rule for determining whether a code is included or not. -->

<!-- The best way to do this is to determine if a code in the list of inclusions is a **prefix** of a given code. In other words, if we specified *T74* as an inclusion, then code *T74* followed by any number of digits/letters should be included. -->

<!-- The way to implement this in code is through regular expression matching using the start of line character *\^*, or with in-built functions such as *base::startsWith()*, or *stringr::str\_starts()*. -->
<!-- Note that *stringr::str\_starts()* is only a wrapper for *stringr::str\_detect()*, and in our case we want to pase a concatenation of codes -->

<!-- Note that another potential approach would be to simply match substrings, however, this results in erroneous matches such as ICD-9 code *967* matching ICD-9 code *E967*. This is a computationally faster approach, of course. -->

<!-- ## What's the best function to use computationally? -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!--   c(agi_2010_processed_long$code, schnitzer_2004_processed$icd9code, schnitzer_2011_inclusions_empirical_processed$icd9code) -->
<!-- ) -->

<!--   sapply(targetCodes, function(target) any(sapply(inclusionCodes, function(incl) base::startsWith(target, prefix=incl))), USE.NAMES = FALSE), -->
<!--   stringr::str_detect(targetCodes, pattern=paste(add_caret(escape_dot(inclusionCodes)),collapse="|"))   -->

<!-- # Converting ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-9 and ICD-10 -->

<!-- When converting from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10, there are three approaches: -->

<!-- * General Equivalence mapping (ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM & vice versa) -->
<!-- * Conceptual mapping -->
<!-- * Keyword mapping -->

<!-- ## ICD-9-CM & ICD-10-CM General Equivalence Mapping (GEM) -->

<!-- The General Equivalence Mapping (GEM) is a set of two reference files that show the mapping from ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM codes and vice versa, where appropriate. These were compiled by the CDC in the USA, for the purposes of compatibility of the respective billing systems. We can use these to algorhythmically generate the mapping from ICD-9-CM codes to ICD-10-CM. -->

<!-- Because the ICD-9-CM codes we are interested in have been specified at varying levels of specificity, we treat the procided codes as prefixes, and extract all codes that match that prefix. Prefix matching ensures we capture all codes at the provided codes' level of specifcity or higher. This generates a large number of codes which can be used "blindly" to compile a final list of matching ICD-10-CM codes. -->

<!-- The ICD-10-CM codes identified this way will then need to be mapped further to WHO ICD-10 codes - in most cases, this involves truncating (the final characters of) the more specific ICD-10-CM code to the most specific existing ICD-10 level. In some cases, ICD-10-CM codes will be generated that only exist in ICD-10-CM and not ICD-10: these codes can be further matched to ICD-10 codes by keyword matching. -->

<!-- ## Conceptual mapping -->

<!-- This refers to mapping high level headings/chapters in ICD-9 to ICD-10. For example, ICD-9 codes *960-979 Poisoning by drugs/medicinals* have a high-level equivalent in ICD-10: *T36-T50 Poisoning by drugs, medicaments and biological substances*. This is discovered manually, as there is no high-level equivalence mapping available. -->

<!-- At this high level, ICD-9-CM codes are equivalent to ICD-9 codes, so ICD-9-CM headings, where appropriate, can be converted directly to ICD-10 headings. -->

<!-- The disadvantage of this method is that without detailed review, we may inadvertently include or exclude codes where the semantics of a heading are different between ICD-9 and ICD-10. -->

<!-- ## Keyword mapping -->

<!-- This refers to finding equivalent keywords between the coding systems: for example, ICD-9-CM *852.0 Traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage* has an ICD-10 equivalent *S06.6 Traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage*. Note that the CM versions of ICD use American spelling (h**e**morrhage), and ICD-10 uses British spelling (h**ae**morrhage). This is the most labour intensive method, as it involves careful deliberations in including or excluding cases. -->

<!-- ## TODO: move elsewhere Comparing conceptual mapping to GEM algorithm -->

<!-- Below demonstrates the mismatch between the two approaches: -->

<!-- Converting the range of ICD-9-CM codes 960-979: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- poisoning_icd9cm <- as.character(960:979) -->
<!-- poisoning_icd10 <- paste0("T", 36:50) -->

<!-- gem_poisoning <- -->
<!--   bind_rows( -->
<!--     gem_icd10cm %>%  -->
<!--       filter(str_starts(target,pattern=paste(paste0("^",poisoning_icd9cm),collapse="|"))) %>% -->
<!--       rename(map = source, code = target), -->
<!--     gem_icd9cm %>%  -->
<!--       filter(str_starts(source,pattern=paste(paste0("^",poisoning_icd9cm),collapse="|"))) %>% -->
<!--       rename(map = target, code = source) -->
<!--   ) -->

<!-- conceptual_poisoning <- -->
<!--   icd10_codes_UK %>%  -->
<!--   filter(str_detect(code,pattern=paste(paste0("^",poisoning_icd10),collapse="|"))) %>% -->
<!--   filter(selectable=="Y") -->

<!-- ## how many GEM mapping codes are not covered by the conceptual codes? -->
<!-- gem_poisoning %>% -->
<!--   filter(!str_detect(map, pattern=paste(paste0("^",conceptual_poisoning$code),collapse = "|"))) %>% -->
<!--   nrow -->

<!-- ## are any conceptual codes not covered by the GEM? -->
<!-- ## for this we truncate all GEM codes to 4 characters -->
<!-- conceptual_poisoning %>% -->
<!--   filter(!code %in% (gem_poisoning$map %>% substr(., start=1, stop=4))) -->

<!-- ## The above code is actually conceptually equivalent to ICD-10-CM code T489, which isn't in ICD-10: -->
<!-- icd::explain_code("T489") -->

<!-- # TODO: formalise the steps, include some kind of fuzzy matching on keywords between ICD-9 and ICD-10 -->

<!-- # Steps: -->
<!-- #   sort out individual ICD-9-CM codes -->
<!-- #   COmbine the backward & forward map -->
<!-- #   Truncate to 4 or 5 characters (TODO: figure out when to truncate to 5 characters!) -->
<!-- #   Search ICD-10 master list, find which cases not matched -->
<!-- #   Non-matching cases search by keyword using fuzzy search -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Cross-mapping inclusion codes -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- # TODO: complete these tables -->

<!-- # idea is that we compile, for each class of codes (inclusion, exclusion), tables of GEM-derived equivalents & keyword derived equivalents, and in some cases manually specify which codes are equivalent, e.g. poisoning codes -->

<!-- schnitzer_2011_inclusion_codes_mapping_gem <- -->
<!--   schnitzer_2011_inclusion_codes %>% -->

<!-- gem_combined %>% -->
<!--   filter(str_starts(icd9cm,pattern=code)) -->

<!-- icd10_codes_UK %>% -->
<!--   filter(agrep(tolower(meaning), pattern=tolower(condition))) -->


<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Doing the cross-walk -->

<!-- There are two directions of mapping: a forward mapping, from ICD-9 to ICD-10, and a backward mapping, from ICD-10 to ICD-9. Their semantics are slightly different, but irrelevant for our use - we are concerned with maximising sensitivity. -->

<!-- For our purposes, we will combine candidate codes from both the forward and backward mapping, and manually review them for appropriateness. -->

<!-- The mapping consists of:  -->

<!-- * single entry equivalents, where there is a one-to-one mapping (or multiple one-to-one mappings) for a given code. In these cases, the source code is sufficiently mapped by a single code (or by any of a range of single codes that are sufficiently similar in their meaning). -->
<!-- * combination entries, where there is a one-to-many mapping (or multiple one-to-many mappings) for a given code. In these cases, multiple target codes need to co-occur to sufficiently cover the meaning implied in the source code. -->

<!-- For our purposes, the above distinction is too complex, and any of the codes involved in any of the mappings will be used instead. For example, consider the ICD-9 code *E904.1, Accident due to lack of food* and its potential mappings: -->

<!-- Forward mapping: `r gem_icd9cm %>% filter(startsWith(source, prefix="E9041"))` -->
<!-- The no_map flag being 1 means there is no forward mapping available. -->

<!-- Backward mapping: `r gem_icd10cm %>% filter(startsWith(target, prefix="E9041"))` -->
<!-- A backward mapping to code *T730XXA Starvation, initial encounter* was found, but note that the combination flag is 1, which means this entry is part of a combination entry. The full entry is the following: -->

<!-- `r gem_icd10cm %>% filter(startsWith(source, prefix="T730XXA"))` -->

<!-- As you can see there are two entries in this combination entry. What this means is that to fully map the meaning of ICD-10-CM code *T730XXA Starvation, initial encounter*, both the codes *9942 Effects of hunger* AND *E904.1, Accident due to lack of food* would need to be included. -->

<!-- For our purposes, the (incomplete) backward mapping is sufficient: we are not concerned with obtaining a maximally equivalent mapping so a smaller degree of overlap is okay. -->

<!-- ## Discrepancy between ICD-9 and ICD-9-CM -->

<!-- There isn't a documented comparison between the WHO and the CM versions of ICD codes, so I'm documenting discrepancies as I go along. The systems are required to agree up to the 4th digit level, which means the systems are free to assign any meaning to the 5th digit and beyond.  -->
<!-- A good example is the listing of codes *995.5*: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ## ICD-9 (WHO) -->
<!-- icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(code_decimal,pattern="^995.5")) %>% select(code_decimal, meaning) -->

<!-- ## ICD-9-CM -->
<!-- tibble(code=icd::children("995.5"), meaning=sapply(icd::children("995.5"), icd::explain_code, USE.NAMES = FALSE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In this case the 4th digit code is specific enough to warrant inclusion of the entire range in both cases. Hopefully this will be the case throughout. -->

<!-- Another example, *E968*: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- ## ICD-9 (WHO) -->
<!-- icd9_codes_UK %>% filter(str_detect(code_decimal,pattern="^E968")) %>% select(code_decimal, meaning) -->

<!-- ## ICD-9-CM -->
<!-- tibble(code=icd::children("E968."), meaning=sapply(icd::children("E968"), icd::explain_code, USE.NAMES = FALSE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
