# overview of wrangling ---------------------------------------------------

## In the ICD hierarchy, most CCS categories capture an entire range of codes at
## 3 digit (ICD-9) and 3 character (ICD-10) level; There are a few code ranges
## where codes belonging to the range fit into different CCS categories, as well
## as a few codes scattered across different ICD categories that were also
## included

## I first compute the number of codes included in a single ICD 'category' this
## is the non-selectable code F05, for example, and its selectable subdivisions
## F051, F052, etc., are counted as 'category members'. If CCS includes an ICD
## category that includes all of its members, we can include the category,
## rather than enumerating all the individual codes. These are dealt with in the
## 'simple range' object. The remaining codes are then enumerated.
