In order to be reimbursed for the care they provide, hospitals in the United States are required to use a standard system to code all discharge diagnoses: the International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9). Although ICD-9 codes specific for child maltreatment exist, they do not identify all maltreatment-related hospital and emergency department discharges. To increase the usefulness of medical data for public health surveillance of child maltreatment, this project sought to identify ICD-9 codes that are suggestive of child maltreatment.
Methods
After review of the literature and discussions with experts, injuries and conditions that should raise suspicion of child maltreatment (physical or sexual abuse or neglect) were identified and a list of corresponding ICD codes was compiled. Using a statewide electronic database of hospital discharges and emergency department (ED) visits for the year 2000, visits by children assigned these ICD codes were identified, a sample of visits was selected, and medical records were reviewed to assess the circumstances of the injury or illness that led to the visit. Based on information in the medical record, the injury or illness was classified as maltreatment-related, or not.
Results
There were 3,684 visits selected for review. Of these, 2,826 records were reviewed and classified; 1,200 (43\%) records met the criteria for being maltreatment-related, 1,419 (50\%) contained adequate information indicating the injury/condition was not likely maltreatment-related, and 207 (7\%) records did not contain enough information to classify. Sixty-eight ICD codes had {\textgreater}66\% of visits classified as maltreatment-related, the a priori criteria for a code to be considered suggestive of maltreatment. Codes suggestive of maltreatment include specific fractures, burns, and injuries of undetermined intent, among others.
Conclusion
Several ICD codes were found that, when used with age restrictions and other specific exclusion criteria, are suggestive of maltreatment. This information may increase the usefulness of hospital discharge data for public health surveillance of child maltreatment.
Practice implications
Use of these suggestive codes facilitates identifying conditions and injuries that are likely maltreatment-related in hospital discharge and ED visit data. When used in conjunction with ICD maltreatment-specific codes, these suggestive codes may enhance the use of medical data for monitoring child maltreatment trends.},

	abstract = {Background Information on variation in the recording of child maltreatment in administrative healthcare data can help to improve recognition and ensure that services are able to respond appropriately.
Objective To examine variation in the recording of child maltreatment and related diagnoses.
Design Cross-sectional analyses of administrative healthcare records (Hospital Episode Statistics).
Setting and participants Acute injury admissions to the National Health Service in England of children under 5 years of age (1997–2009).
Outcome measure Annual incidence of admission for injury recorded by International Classifications of Diseases 10 codes for maltreatment syndrome (child abuse or neglect) or maltreatment-related features (assault, undetermined cause or adverse social circumstances). Proportion of all admissions for injury coded for maltreatment syndrome or maltreatment-related features.
Results From 1997 to 2009, the annual incidence of injury admissions coded for maltreatment syndrome declined in infants and in 1–3-year-old children while admissions coded for maltreatment-related features increased in all age groups. The combined incidence of these categories remained stable. Overall, 2.6\% of injury admissions in infants, and 0.4–0.6\% in older age groups, had maltreatment syndrome recorded. This prevalence more than doubled when maltreatment-related codes were added (6.4\% in infants, 1.5–2.1\% in older age groups).
Conclusion Despite a shift from maltreatment syndrome to codes for maltreatment-related features, the overall burden has remained stable. In combination, the cluster of codes related to maltreatment identify children likely to meet thresholds for suspecting or considering maltreatment and taking further action, as recommended in recent National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidance, and indicate a considerable burden to which hospitals should respond.},

	abstract = {We explored trends in six developed countries in three types of indicators of child maltreatment for children younger than 11 years, since the inception of modern child protection systems in the 1970s. Despite several policy initiatives for child protection, we recorded no consistent evidence for a decrease in all types of indicators of child maltreatment. We noted falling rates of violent death in a few age and country groups, but these decreases coincided with reductions in admissions to hospital for maltreatment-related injury only in Sweden and Manitoba (Canada). One or more child protection agency indicators increased in five of six countries, particularly in infants, possibly as a result of early intervention policies. Comparisons of mean rates between countries showed five-fold to ten-fold differences in rates of agency indicators, but less than two-fold variation in violent deaths or maltreatment-related injury, apart from high rates of violent child death in the USA. These analyses draw attention to the need for robust research to establish whether the high and rising rates of agency contacts and out-of-home care in some settings are effectively reducing child maltreatment.},
